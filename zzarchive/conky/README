Aqua-rings-110 Conky (v1.10)
----------------------------

Adjust your filepaths for the lua and atomfeed scripts, in the conkyrc:

	lua_load = '~/.config/conky/Aqua-rings-110.lua',
	
	also change the disc mountpoints to your system.

The lua script discmounts need to match as well. Comment out the CPU's,
depending on how many cores you have
